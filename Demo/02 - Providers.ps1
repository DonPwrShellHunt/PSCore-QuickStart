  Normally you can use F5 to run the entire script, or F8 to run one or
  more highlighted lines of code. This script is atypical in that it's just
  a bunch of examples we only want to run via F8. So we'll add the next line
  of code to stop running just in case someone accidentally hits F5.

if ( 1 -eq 1 ) { exit }

# Providers

# Capture the current directory so we can restore it later
$dir = $pwd

#List default Providers
Clear-Host
Get-PSProvider

# Now show how these providers equate to "drives" we can navigate
Clear-Host
Get-PSDrive

# Move to the ENV (environmental variables) drive
Clear-Host
Set-Location env:
Get-ChildItem

# Now move to the provider for variables
Clear-Host
Set-Location variable:
Get-ChildItem

# Set the location back to the drive from the env provider
Set-Location $dir
