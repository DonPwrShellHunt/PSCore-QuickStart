# Install PowerShell Core on Windows

Unlike macOS and Linux, there is not a simple command line way to install PSCore on Windows. Instead, the simplest way is to point you to the Microsoft online documentation [Installing PowerShell on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7).

There you will find links to download the installer and get up and running on your system.
